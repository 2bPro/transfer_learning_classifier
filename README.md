# Transfer learning classifier of medical scans
Experimenting with classifiers and transfer learning in Python3 - Tensorflow, Keras in order to classify medical scans by body part (head, abdomen, chest, arms, legs etc).  

This project is based on the paper "Hello World Deep Learning in Medical Imaging" written by Paras Lakhani et al. [1](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10278-018-0079-6). Any other articles or sources of information will be listed under the [Resources](#resources) section.
